    <h3 class="text-center">Front-end developer from Montpellier, France</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p class="mt-0">
        I am a 28 year old woman from France who was lost for many, many years
        trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I would see everyone
        my age going off to University, knowing what they wanted to do while I
        went to University studying subjects I wasn't interested in. I felt I
        had to try something rather than doing nothing. Unfortunately, it never
        resulted to anything so I ended quiting so I could start working as a
        waitress to earn a living. When COVID hit, the hotel where I was
        employed at went out of business (because they decided it was a good
        time to renovate the hotel, which lead to bankrupcy), I was laid off and
        therefore was on the dole. There was a service included at the center of
        unemployement that offered professional help to find the right career
        path for individuals. I was quite reluctant at first as I had already
        twice before in my life seeked help by professionals for guidance, but
        it was more of a time waster than anything else. But after countless
        hours and months with this partucular professional, she finally helped
        me to find a path that suited me. To become a front-end developer!
